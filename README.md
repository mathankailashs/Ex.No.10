## Aim
To explore how different prompt-engineering methods—such as query decomposition, semantic filtering, decision prompts, and structured formatting—can be used to create high-quality content such as reports, articles, case studies, and creative narratives. The objective is to understand how prompt structures influence coherence, depth, and quality of AI-generated outputs.

---

## Procedure

### 1. Introduction to Prompt Patterns
The following prompting strategies are examined:

- **Query Decomposition:** Breaking complex instructions into smaller parts.  
- **Decision-Making Prompts:** Allowing the model to choose between guided options.  
- **Answer Engineering:** Structuring outputs using formatting rules.  
- **Fact Checklist:** Ensuring factual accuracy for academic/business topics.  
- **Tail Generation:** Extending stories or analyses beyond the initial answer.  
- **Menu Actions:** Presenting multiple paths for the model to continue.  
- **Semantic Filtering:** Controlling tone, style, or domain consistency.

---

### 2. Choosing the Content Type
Examples of content generated using prompt patterns:

- **Reports:** Industry trends, market analysis, sustainability studies  
- **Case Studies:** Business problem–solution narratives  
- **Articles:** Informative and opinion-based writing  
- **Creative Content:** Sci-fi stories, comic scripts, dialogues, etc.

---

### 3. Creating the Prompts
Start with simple instructions and then refine using techniques like:

- Decision-making  
- Tail-generation prompts  
- Structured formatting  
- Tone control through semantic filtering  

---

### 4. Generating and Refining Outputs
Use iterative prompting to enhance clarity and detail:

- **For reports:** Begin with general information → refine using structured headings → add insights  
- **For stories:** Start with characters/settings → build plot → add atmosphere and depth  

---

### 5. Review and Evaluation
Content is evaluated based on:

- **Coherence** – Logical flow of information  
- **Creativity** – Uniqueness and engagement  
- **Accuracy** – Correct facts and data (if applicable)  
- **Tone/Style** – Appropriateness for the content type  

---

## Test Case Scenarios for Content Generation  

Two scenarios were selected as required.

---

# Scenario 1: Business Report on Market Trends  

---

## 1. First Draft (Basic Prompt)
### Prompt
```

Write a short report on current market trends.

```

### Expected Output:
A generic summary mentioning broad trends like digital expansion, rising inflation, online shopping growth, etc., with minimal structure.

---

## 2. Refined Content (Using Prompt Techniques)

### A. Query Decomposition & Answer Engineering
```

Act as a market research analyst. Generate a business report on current market trends in the Indian e-commerce sector for Q1 2025. Structure the report with:

* Overview of Market Size and Growth
* Key Trends (D2C brands, quick commerce, rural penetration)
* Challenges
* Future Outlook & Recommendations

Include clear headings, bullet points, and realistic statistical insights.

```

#### Expected Output:
- Structured report with subheadings  
- Q1 2025 e-commerce growth data  
- Key sector trends  
- Challenges like delivery cost and competition  
- Actionable recommendations  

---

### B. Semantic Filtering & Tail Generation
```

Extend the “Future Outlook and Recommendations” section. Focus on how AI and blockchain will impact Indian e-commerce over the next 3–5 years. Maintain a formal tone. Add a subsection titled "Sustainability in E-commerce".

```

#### Expected Output:
- AI-driven personalization and automation  
- Blockchain-enabled supply chain monitoring  
- Sustainable packaging and carbon-neutral delivery insights  
- Professional tone maintained throughout  

---

## 3. Multiple Versions
- **Version A:** Basic report  
- **Version B:** Structured report with decomposition  
- **Version C:** Enhanced report with semantic filtering and tail extension  

---

## 4. Final Version
A polished business report including:  
- Clear formatting  
- Trend analysis  
- Technology insights  
- Sustainability considerations  
- Professional tone  

---

# Scenario 2: Sci-Fi Short Story  

---

## 1. First Draft (Basic Prompt)
### Prompt
```

Write a short sci-fi story about a space explorer.

```

### Expected Output:
A simple storyline: explorer travels to a planet, encounters an alien, faces a challenge.

---

## 2. Refined Content (Using Prompt Techniques)

### A. Query Decomposition & Answer Engineering
```

Write an 800-word sci-fi story.
Protagonist: Captain Eva Rostova (Year 2342)

Plot Outline:

* Journey: Her solo voyage toward a silent nebula
* Discovery: She finds an abandoned alien megastructure
* Mystery/Threat: A hidden danger emerges
* Resolution/Cliffhanger: End with tension

Use descriptive language, internal thoughts, and a suspenseful tone.

```

#### Expected Output:
- Detailed emotions  
- Rich description of space environments  
- Alien technological details  
- Suspenseful pacing  

---

### B. Decision-Making & Semantic Filtering
```

Choose one threat:
A) Power-draining trap
B) Dormant alien intelligence
C) Ancient museum

Choose B. Add cosmic-horror elements and an ambiguous ending. Maintain immersive, atmospheric prose.

```

#### Expected Output:
- Story revolves around awakening alien intelligence  
- Cosmic horror themes  
- Tense and unresolved ending  
- Vivid atmospheric writing  

---

## 3. Multiple Versions
- **Version A:** Basic sci-fi story  
- **Version B:** Structured story using decomposition  
- **Version C:** Enhanced story using decision-based and semantic-filter prompts  

---

## 4. Final Version
A fully developed sci-fi story with:  
- Strong character depth  
- Immersive world-building  
- Mystery and tension  
- Horror-infused atmosphere  

---

## Conclusion
This experiment demonstrates how different prompt patterns significantly improve AI-generated content. Techniques such as decomposition, semantic control, decision prompts, and answer engineering transform simple outputs into structured, coherent, and high-quality reports and stories. Iterative refinement enhances creativity, accuracy, and tone, making prompt engineering essential for effective AI-assisted content creation.
